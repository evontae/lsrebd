# Advanced SRE Projects

## 8. Advanced Observability Techniques
**Project: Distributed Tracing and Logging Pipeline**

### Setup:
- [ ] Set up a Kubernetes cluster with your microservices application
- [ ] Ensure Prometheus and Grafana are installed from the previous project

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement OpenTelemetry:
  - [ ] Install the OpenTelemetry Operator in your cluster
  - [ ] Instrument your application code with OpenTelemetry SDKs
- [ ] Set up distributed tracing:
  - [ ] Deploy Jaeger as the tracing backend
  - [ ] Configure your services to send traces to Jaeger
- [ ] Implement logging pipeline:
  - [ ] Deploy the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to your cluster
  - [ ] Configure Fluentd or Fluent Bit as log collectors
- [ ] Correlate logs and traces:
  - [ ] Modify your application to include trace IDs in log messages
  - [ ] Create Kibana dashboards that link logs to corresponding traces
- [ ] Create comprehensive dashboards:
  - [ ] Design Grafana dashboards that combine metrics, logs, and traces
  - [ ] Implement drill-down capabilities from metrics to logs to traces
- [ ] Implement log analysis:
  - [ ] Use Elasticsearch's machine learning features for log anomaly detection
  - [ ] Set up alerts based on unusual log patterns
- [ ] Testing:
  - [ ] Generate varied traffic patterns to your application
  - [ ] Verify the correlation between metrics, logs, and traces
- [ ] Documentation:
  - [ ] Document your observability pipeline architecture
  - [ ] Create runbooks for common troubleshooting scenarios
- [ ] Clean up:
  - [ ] Remove any non-essential components from your cluster
  - [ ] Ensure proper data retention policies are in place for logs and traces

## 9. AIOps and Predictive Analytics
**Project: AI-Driven Incident Prediction and Resolution**

### Setup:
- [ ] Ensure your Kubernetes cluster with the microservices application is running
- [ ] Set up a development environment for machine learning (e.g., Jupyter Notebook)

### Tasks:
- [ ] Data collection:
  - [ ] Collect historical metrics, logs, and incident data from your application
  - [ ] Set up a pipeline to continuously gather this data
- [ ] Develop a failure prediction model:
  - [ ] Preprocess and analyze the collected data
  - [ ] Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM) to predict system failures
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection:
  - [ ] Use unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest) for detecting anomalies in system metrics
  - [ ] Deploy the anomaly detection model to process real-time metrics
- [ ] Create an incident classification system:
  - [ ] Develop a natural language processing model to classify incident reports
  - [ ] Integrate the model with your incident management workflow
- [ ] Develop an automated response system:
  - [ ] Create a rule-based system for initial incident response
  - [ ] Implement a chatbot interface for interacting with the response system
- [ ] Implement a recommendation engine:
  - [ ] Develop a system that suggests resolution steps based on historical incident data
  - [ ] Integrate the recommendations into your incident response workflow
- [ ] Testing and validation:
  - [ ] Conduct A/B testing to compare AI-driven incident management with traditional methods
  - [ ] Continuously monitor and refine the AI models based on real-world performance
